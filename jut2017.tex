{\it Three distinct trends have emerged that have disrupted the
dominance of privately-owned, combustion car transport in the
UK. First, the emergence of the electric powertrain as an affordable
means of transport, with the potential to address many ‘pump-to-tire’
shortcomings, especially CO$_2$ emissions, air and noise pollution. The
second is the rise of new hire models of car ownership: the concept of
paying for the use of a car per single leg of a journey, addressing
systematic impacts such as residential parking,
purchase-justifying-use and social division. Thirdly, the rise of
`smart city thinking', the concept that increased connectivity and
data availability can be harnessed to create value, specifically here
as it impacts transport. We define the combination of the three as the
`Tri-Opt' of private transport -- three disruptors that should not be
considered in isolation but as interacting levers -- an inflection of
the `Energy Trilemma'.

In this paper, we apply systems thinking and a mixed methodology of
workshops, interviews and systems modelling drawing upon the UK city
of Bristol's Smart EV Transport Hub project to identify concepts that
positively combine two or more of these three `Opts'. Subsequently,
the use cases are evaluated qualitatively for their broad perception
of value and potential. Segmentation is subsequently undertaken to
characterise and generalise groups of concepts to inform recommended
stakeholder actions. We demonstrate that synergistic overlaps are many
and combinations create significant value. Our data highlights that of
the greatest value are those use cases that the current literature
base has explored the least, and can be characterised as requiring
significant public and private sector collaboration. We thus highly
recommended that public-private sector collaboration in private
transport -- particularly on the issues of electric vehicles, smart
cities and mobility-as-a-service -- is prioritised for further
research and investigation.}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

\subsection{Problem Space}

A growing corpus of research -- as well as associated policy
declarations -- is gathering consensus on
the view that the prevailing private transport paradigm of developed
nations has a finite lifespan; a culture that consists of primarily
privately-owned internal combustion engine (ICE) automobiles is
unlikely to survive the next thirty years in its current form, in the
face of economic, social, and environmental
pressures~\citep{lerner:2011,van-audenhove-et-al:2014,black-et-al:2016}.
Several distinct trends in existing research have emerged as potential
disruptors; three in particular are identified and analysed in this
paper. Firstly, the emergence of electrical motors as the primary
alternate powertrain for private
automobiles~\citep{paffumi-et-al:2015,gnann-et-al:2015}.  Secondly --
and more in its infancy -- the trend of transitions to new car use
models, which is regularly referred to within the collective term of
`Mobility-as-a-Service'~\citep{tscatapult:2016}. A third -- the
broadest and most in its infancy -- the emergence of what is being
called the smart city theorem. This capitalises on the use of systems
that harness the opportunities of increased connectivity and the
collection and curation of data to provide
value~\citep{townsend:2013,cosgrave-et-al:2013,ibm:2014}

However, disruption to private transport in the UK -- even with recent
wide-ranging policy pronouncements~\citep{bbcnews:2017} -- measured on
any one of these individual trends is, at present, slow. Electric cars
only make up a minor share of the UK car market, with limited charging
infrastructure outside of major urban areas and
motorways~\citep{dft:2008}; short-term hire transport models have yet
to be proved at a significant scale in the UK, beyond simpler modes
such as for cycling~\citep{kamargianni-et-al:2016}. Furthermore, smart
cities are, in many cases, little more than a long term strategic
aspiration for governments and policymakers, with few significant
instances of demonstrators (including Glasgow and Bristol in the UK),
many of which are too early in their lifetime to be able to provide
any substantial conclusions about the value they produce from
data~\citep{caragliu-et-al:2011}.

Some of the most successful disruptive private transport initiatives
of recent times can however often be observed combining two or three
of these opportunities. AutoLib, the Paris-based EV car hire scheme
offers single leg trips around the city and since 2011 has already
grown to over 500,000 members and 4,000 cars across an extensive array
of car nodes. Tesla Motors in the USA have also heavily emphasised new
business models enabled by data and the role of new ownership models
in their latest corporate strategy release~\citep{musk:2016}. Existing
literature has extensively examined each trend in its isolation but
there is less exploration of combinations of two or more (see
Figure~\ref{fig:triopt}), with even less focusing on the notion of
synergy between the three trends as a principle. The idea of three
significant issues needing to be considered in conjunction with one
another is not a radical concept however, as seen in the inverse, but
principally similar, `energy trilemma'~\citep{wec:2015}. This paper --
building upon previous work~\citep{cooper-et-al-sose:2015} with
substantially extended theoretical framing, data and analysis -- will
focus on investigating the manifestations of the overlaps of these
three opportunities within the context of the city of Bristol in the
UK.

\subsection{Electric Vehicles}

Electric vehicles (EVs), driven by electric motors powered by a
battery, have emerged as an environmentally sustainable alternative to
ICEs. As well as reducing carbon emissions, EVs typically have lower
noise and air pollution, can be cheaper to run per mile and reduce
transport's dependency on fossil fuels~\citep{postevs:2010}. It is
widely accepted that an alternate (and scalable) energy source is
necessary for the UK transport network in the future, with
electrification considered the most likely choice; by 2020, the UK's
Department for Transport predicts there will be 1.5m EVs in
use~\citep{dft:2008}.

Most of the world's major automotive manufacturers have released
purpose-designed electric cars (different from ICEs that have a
substituted EV power train); some have gone so far as to make
significant strategic investment in the concept by releasing entire
electric car ranges, such as BMW's i Series range. Personal cars and
small commercial vehicles account for 13\% of all UK carbon
emissions~\citep{lumsden:2012} so the direct `pump-to-tire' benefits of
electric cars are highly significant. Legislation in many countries is
a double-edged sword: penalising ICE users and incentivising the
purchase of EVs. EVs bring with them several challenges, however: the
purchase price of EVs, predominantly due to current battery
technology, is yet to be comparable to an equivalent ICE; the embodied
carbon of EVs, again due to the battery component, is typically higher
than an equivalent ICE, and the generation of electricity to meet
charging patterns is theorised to bring with it considerable
logistical difficulties on national
grids~\citep{su-et-al:2011,akhavan-rezai-et-al:2015}. Furthermore, some
of the benefits, such as CO$_2$ savings, are dependant on the method of
generation of the electricity used in the EV.

There are several barriers to the adoption of EVs. Some of which are
psychological for the end user; ICE owners have shown range anxiety --
a concern of `running out of
juice'~\citep{oflev:2011,yilmaz+krein:2012}. Evidence rarely supports
such concerns: 95\% of all private vehicles journeys in the UK are $<25$
miles~\citep{oflev:2011}, a distance current EVs are easily able to
service. Other user perceptions include concerns over battery
lifetimes, the risk of obsolescence from investing in a product from a
rapidly advancing technology, and the higher price of EV purchase.
Many also criticise an absence of second-hand EVs for purchase. Fleet
vehicles accounted for 63\% of all new vehicle sales in the UK in
2011; as such they are a dominant influence on the cars that are
subsequently available for sale in the secondary purchase
markets~\citep{fleets:2012}. There is a growing trend for EVs in fleet
vehicles due to reduced running costs, so it is likely a substantive
used EV market will start to emerge in the near future.


\subsection{Digital Innovation and Smart Technologies}

`Smart' as a mechanism is a contemporary and rapidly growing area of
research; as such, a consensus on the concept's definition has yet to
be reached. A review of academics, policy makers and industrial
practitioners in the field suggests a recurring fundamental theme of
the use of increased data (both in supply and quality) and
connectivity to create
value~\citep{komninos:2002,arup-et-al:2011,harrison+abbottdonnelly:2011,batty-et-al:2012,buscher:2014}. The
rise of interest in data-based value creation within cities can be
related to a number of trends:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item {\emph{The rapid acceleration in the production of data.}}
Several key societal developments, including the rise of wide-spread
internet connectivity (particularly high-speed mobile connectivity)
and social networking, has caused an exponential increase in data
production; rapidly growing datasets have thus spurred experimentation
as to their potential new uses. `Big data' is regularly used to refer
to such colossal quantities, and is sometimes defined as a data set
big enough to be considered for use in smart value-producing
systems. feasible~\citep{hollands:2008,ibmsmartcities:2009,ciscoconcities:2010}.
\item {\emph{The rapid increase in the ability to collect more
specific, higher-value data.}} Improvements in sensor and transmission
technology have resulted in data collection devices becoming more
financially affordable and spatially
practical~\citep{townsend:2013}. The development of mesh networks, the
mechanism of two-way communicating sensor nodes distributed over vast
areas, can provide high resolution data facilitating accurate
statements or the ability to reliably track and understand sensed
activity. Furthermore, the internet of things (IoT) -- defined as the notion
of two-way connectivity being integrated in every day items -- could
enable transitions from machine-human-machine interaction to simply
machine-machine.
\item {\emph{Improvements in data storage and processing.}}  Storing
and processing data is becoming significantly cheaper. These trends
combine to enable complex, intensive analytics on data vast data sets
-- such as on the scale of a city -- to be processed and presented for
actioning fast enough to be deemed `live'.
\end{enumerate}

Discussion is increasingly refer to data as a raw material (sometimes
going so far as to describe it as an emerging fifth `utility'),
creating the notion that data can and should be used as a primary
input to a business model~\citep{arup-et-al:2011}. This may involve
taking data across traditional
`silos'~\citep{shapiro:2006,tsoukalas:2008}. Increasingly, this also
represents the pressing focus on whole-life environmental impacts of
ICTs~\citep{cooper-et-al-gsict:2015}. `Creating value' can be defined
in many ways, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\emph{Faster processes:}} for example, using traffic data to
pro-actively update signs in real time, rather than the slow, reactive
methods by which traffic is informally advised against taking certain
routes.
\item {\emph{Fairer:}} for example, real time demand-based tolls for
motorways, charging higher rates for peak travel times, or when air
quality is particularly poor in the city, and conversely, lower rates
at off peak times.
\item {\emph{At lower cost:}} for example, water pipes containing flow
sensors to identify the accurate location of leaks as they emerge,
rather than expensive and time-consuming excavations and visual
inspections~\citep{cosgrave-et-al:2014}.
\item {\emph{Without human interaction:}} For example, when a first
aid dispatch can be made at the detection of a heart attack in a
public space, rather than requiring on-lookers to assess the situation
and intervene. This can improve instances of human error, social
boundaries and subjective judgement although there is a discussion of
the shortcomings of overly objective assessment in processes.
\end{itemize}

While there is acknowledgement that it is not without ethical and
societal concerns~\citep{bimber:1990,oatley-et-al_dasc:2015}, there is
an extensive literature base documenting the potential impact of
digital innovation, through these improvements, in the transport
sector~\citep{enoch:2015}.

One trend absent from this paper's analysis could be considered the
issue of autonomous vehicles, and that if it were to be included it
might best be considered within this category, or as an individual
macro trend. It is acknowledged that in future revisions of this
framework this consideration should be made, but is currently out of
scope for this paper.


\subsection{New Ownership Models}

`Mobility-as-a-Service' has grown to be a concept that is specifically
appreciated in modern transport dialogues~\citep{tscatapult:2016}. It
is best defined as a transition from a paradigm of relying on a
product that is purchased to provide mobility functionality, to a
service where the outcome of moving from one location to another is
provided, disassociated from any requirement for asset ownership, and
typically arranged on a journey-by-journey basis.

In other modes of private transport in the UK, such as bike use, an
increasing number of citizens are participating in short term hire
models of use, particularly in urban contexts. Rather than bearing the
capital and logistical cost of owning a bike, individuals rent the
bike from a node of bikes near the origin of their journey, complete
their journey, and return the bike to a node near their
destination. As such they are purchasing the outcome of mobility from
one destination to another, or `as-a-service'. Once seen as radical,
examples such as London's cycle hire (also known colloquially as
``Boris Bikes'', after a high-profile Mayor of London) scheme has
demonstrated not only the popularity of the operating model, but also
the indirect benefits, illustrated by the significant increase in
cycling in the city bringing health benefits, but also a degree of
substitution for car journeys. A range of drivers have been suggested
for the emergence of this paradigm:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\emph{Changing societal values:}} whereby evidence has
suggested a decrease in the cultural value placed on car ownership;
conflict with an increased desire to live in vibrant urban areas
within walking distance of workplace and other amenities and the
spatial restrictions of car ownership in such
scenarios~\citep{jenks+burgess:2011}.
\item {\emph{Changing economic situations:}} increasing costs of car
ownership, particularly in insurance (particularly for young
individuals) and fuel cost.
\item {\emph{Changing effectiveness of privately-owned car
transportation:}} an increasing frustration with congested transport
systems and an increasing desire to travel to A-to-B reliably,
regardless of the specific comfort of one's `own' motor vehicle.
\item {\emph{Proof of concept:}} Driven by commercial ventures showing
the viability of alternate private transport paradigms. Traditional
car hire companies in particular are beginning to explore short-term,
distributed `car club', return journey (`A-to-A' journeys) offerings,
whereas emerging start-ups are offering complete A-B services, such as
the aforementioned Autolib.
\end{itemize}

% \subsection{The UK Context}

% In the UK, over the last 60 years, the profile of citizen journeys has
% transitioned rapidly from public transport dominated to private
% transport-dominated, stabilising around the last millennia
% [FOOTNOTE1]. Vocal, anti-automotive political agendas, global
% recession and rising oil prices have all emerged since as powerful,
% anti-private transport influences. However, they have done little to
% reduce private transport, with the per-mile travel profile appearing
% largely unchanged, tending instead to a marginally lower equilibrium
% level from 2000 to today. This is displayed in Figure 1a,
% contextualised by the historical car ownership trends in Figure
% 1b. However, there is emerging evidence that over the last 10 years,
% cars per person are declining, driven by lower ownership rates,
% particularly driven by younger drivers [REF6]. 


% \begin{figure}[!htp]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/uktransportshare.png}
% \caption{Car ownership trends in the UK}
% \label{fig:uktransportshare}
% \end{figure}

% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/ukcarsperperson.png}
% \caption{Transport share in the UK}
% \label{fig:ukcarsperperson}
% \end{figure}

% In theory, it is clear that at present public transport is both
% technically (in terms of emissions per head) and systematically
% (second-order effects, such as congestion, social and economic
% consequences) superior to private transport and this has been
% understood for some time [REF7]. However, it is equally apparent that
% the unit cost of converting a percentage of transport users from
% private to public transport increases with conversion. In other words,
% in a hypothetical world where everyone uses private transport, to
% convert the easiest first 10\% of users, a network of urban buses and
% trains can be run cost-effectively and efficiently. The last 10\% of
% the population, however, requires a vast and complex network that
% operates constantly and at high frequencies, and is for all intents
% and purposes, impossible to deliver. As such, it is clear that there
% is a fraction of transport that, for reasons of financial and
% practical limitations, will always remain private transport, and that
% that fraction is not necessarily `small'. Although the UK does not
% currently operate at or even near this ‘minimum’ private transport
% threshold, acknowledgement that any such unavoidable level exists is
% not necessarily popular in transport policy.

% As such, there is clear motivation that the impacts of private
% transport, both pump-to-tire and systematically, should be
% mitigated. This is a popular and high-growth area of research both
% commercially and academically; within the last 20 years, the average
% personal automobile efficiency has improved drastically.  Today,
% alternate  powertrains  such as electric motors that are more
% efficient and less polluting that ICEs, are not
% only technically viable, but a key component of many automotive giants
% strategies; the aforementioned BMW i Series range is a high profile
% example of significant strategic investment in the transition of
% retail automobiles to EVs. However, it is clear that drivetrain
% transitions alone cannot deal with the systematic drawbacks of private
% transport, such as congestion, spatial requirements of parking and
% social isolation of the have-cars and have-nots, which have been
% addressed to an order-of-magnitude lesser extent. Technical
% suggestions for these problems do exist, such as driverless, automated
% cars and personal rapid transit (PRT) schemes, but both are a long way
% from a ready-to-rollout status [REF8]. Crucially, for every change
% that reduces the negative impact of private transport (of either
% kind), or more accurately, convincingly depicts itself as doing so,
% private transport is further legitimised, and efforts to transfer
% journeys to public transport are weakened. Thus improvements to the
% performance of private transport need to be sufficiently substantial
% to mitigate any systematic `rebound' effect of reduced public
% transport use.
 
% Private transport solutions are almost exclusively the remit of the
% private sector; if we focus on the mode of car, these can be broadly
% categorised as automotive retailers, car hire firms and taxi
% companies. The public sector’s potential influence is relatively broad
% and classifiable into two main groups. Firstly, regulation, subsidies
% and taxation, which while exercised to bring about sustainability
% improvements in car design and car use, are generally applied at an
% industry level and are balanced against other political desires such
% as keeping motor product prices low and the automotive commercial
% environment favorable to investment [REF9]. Secondly, through the
% provision of infrastructure, which while said to be becoming
% increasingly mindful of its systematic impacts, is still predominantly
% designed to meet the current and near-future needs of its users rather
% than dictate them (Institution of Civil Engineers, 2016). 

% Political action is thus limited by this simple catch-22: public
% transport is the ideal, but impractical to reach saturation. Private
% transport is undesirable, but unavoidable, yet efforts to improve it
% also make it more prevalent. Private transport services must remain
% commercially profitable if they remain in the hands of the private
% sector, and at present, the government appears not inclined to lead
% radical changes in its nature from the limited influences it has at
% its disposal. It seems change must come primarily from the private
% sector (Westlake, 2016).

% Technically, it may be argued there thus exists an optimum – a level
% of improvement of private transport that, when the reduction in public
% transport uptake is factored in, results in the lowest overall impact
% in the UK’s travel emissions. There are many more secondary effects
% that could also be considered from this first deduction; not all
% improvements to private transport reduce public transport uptake to
% the same degree; nor is the UK a homogenous mass of two types of
% transport user. Attempts to penalise private transporters who could
% transfer to public transport and do not, such as through taxation,
% frequently damages those who cannot transfer [REF10] [REF11].

% Thus we can see how the three opportunities introduced previously come
% together to address three of the main difficulties in the current
% transport paradigm in the UK:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item {\textbf{Electric vehicles}} -- enabling significant improvement
% in the direct, pump-to-tire impacts of private transport, one of the
% most substantial steps on the long term achievements in this space;
% \item {\textbf{Mobility-as-a-Service models}} -- enabling significant
% improvement in the systematic impacts of private transport, a radical
% first step in achievement in this space;
% \item {\textbf{Digital innovation}} -- enabling significant
% improvement in operational cost, customer engagement, system
% management and new revenue streams, appeasing the private sector's
% requirement for profitable ventures.
% \end{enumerate}

% The actions of transport stakeholders in the next 10 years will
% dictate how much these trends are harnessed, encouraged or ignored in
% private sector transport, and ultimately how the UK’s transport
% culture changes as a result.


\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}

\subsection{Objectives}

This paper thus sets out to achieve the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item To explore a range of use cases in the UK's private transport
system that involve the three elements of the `tri-opt'. These use
cases must use at least two of the elements in combination and produce
value.
\item To understand, to a qualitative degree of accuracy,
  the varying value perceived by our stakeholders to be presented in
  the identified `combination' use cases. 
% \item To understand the broad characteristics of the identified use
%   cases, with a focus on barriers and enablers to their valuation and
%   implementation.
\item To segment the use cases, considering both their
  characteristics, value potential and value certainty with a view to forming
  recommended policymaker actions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Philosophy}

This paper will take a systems-thinking perspective to consider the
instances of when these trends create double and triple overlaps. For
discovered instances, interaction of the tri-opts will be explored,
and the value seen in the use case and certainty of that value
measured. With respect to the definition and measurement of value, due
the broad scope of this paper, value will be considered qualitatively
through research facilitator review (detailed in the following
section), with an emphasis on a use case's comparative value compared
to other identified use cases. Value will be considered to all
stakeholders within the system boundary; in this case the UK city of
Bristol.

\subsection{Methods}

This paper implies a mixed methods approach, primarily -- but not
exclusively -- focused around a joint Bristol City Council and
University of Bristol research study into the potential of a `smart
electric vehicle transport hub' -- a proposed development that
combined the three proposed trends on a physical site offering both
public (bus and `park and ride') and private (as-a-service electric
car hire) transport services. The methods used are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Five two-hour workshops with the presence of senior Bristol City
Council staff, senior University of Bristol academics, and consulting
engineers from built environment consultancy Arup;
\item Ten semi-structured one hour interviews with a range of
transport stakeholders in the city of Bristol, including bus
operators, policy legislators, legal and financial professionals, all
providing insight anonymously;
\item A survey of 48 citizens of Bristol subscribed to Source West, an
independent non-profit organisation representing the interests of
citizens using electric vehicles;
\item A range systems dynamics modelling to understand further detail
  value in a few specific use cases, explained in more detail when
  introduced.
\end{itemize}

Throughout the first two methodological approaches, uncovered use
cases and the role of the `opts' were documented, and the researchers
attempted to score participant's views and reactions against two
dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\emph{The value:}} Participants were encouraged to voice their
perceived scales of the benefit to all stakeholders within the
city. Researchers then estimated this sentiment using an approximate
scale of 0-100 where: 0 corresponded to no perceivable value in any
circumstance; 50 a moderate but noteworthy value; and 100 a value of
vast magnitude that could not perceivably be made tangibly larger.
\item {\emph{The certainty:}} Participants were encouraged to voice
their perceived certainty of their value estimations. Researchers then
estimated this sentiment using an approximate scale of 0-100 where: 0
corresponded to stakeholders suggesting their estimation was
essentially random and dependent on a vast range of unpredictable
external factors; 50 a relatively confident estimate but that was
reliant on some external factors; and 100 a technical certainty that
relied on no external factors.
\end{itemize}

The third and forth methodological approaches were used primarily to
shape and detail certain use cases, and did not directly feed into
scoring.\\

Individuals were selected for the workshop and interview based on four
criteria: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Individuals involved in the delivery of key urban services in
the UK city of Bristol and as a result hold a strong understanding of
the performance criteria of these systems and what value may look like
from an operator’s perspective;
\item Individuals who have experience of the urban challenges of the
city and have a strong understand of how value may look like from a
public good perspective;
\item Individuals who had experiencing researching MaaS, EV and smart
transport solutions in private transport systems in the UK;
\item Individuals who the previous three groups recommended for
insight on the problem space.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Workshops}

Prospective candidates with the greatest scoring across the four
criteria were prioritised for workshop over interviews. The workshops
were iterative, designed to build a use case library while refining
understanding of value and value certainty as other methods were
completed. As such, workshop participants were -- as much as practical
-- constant throughout.  Each workshop was structured in the following
manner: presentation of understanding of identified use cases so far;
open discussion of possible new use cases or new segmentation of use
cases; discussion of evidence on value and value certainty in use
cases, based on data provided and participant view points. The
workshops were designed so that all participants were able to
contribute to all use cases.

\subsubsection{Interviews}

Interview participants were recruited by the same methodology as
workshop participants, with the interviews undertaken in a
semi-structured manner as guided by the best practice from
~\citet{king+horrocks:2010}. All interviews followed the broad
structure of: participant background (e.g. experience of the
individual and current role), broad discussion of the problem space
and alignment around issues (i.e. the tri-opt as a concept and its
component parts); an exploration of how these concepts might create
uses cases and their benefits, providing both space to provide new use
cases, but also testing on-going hypothesis; finishing with a free
discussion.

\subsubsection{Assessment}

Interviews were manually coded using Computer-Assisted Qualitative
Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS). Coding was used to find commonalities
across suggested use cases, comments regarding value and value
certainty, and comments regarding wider context/barriers and enablers,
etc.  The process of quantifying qualitative information was
undertaken based on the 8-step process~\citep{chi:1997}. In
particular, Chi's recommendation to use interrater was implemented,
ensuring that multiple individuals quantified scores independently and
checked for alignment.

\subsection{Individual Uses Cases}

\subsubsection{Car Component State (Smart/MaaS/EV)}

In the traditional car hire industry, it is common practice to run a
maintenance program that involves inspection above the frequency that
would be recommended for a privately-owned automobile, designed to
reduce the likely car may suffer from a failure while hired by a
customer.

Using mechanical health sensors -- what could be considered a `smart'
element -- attached to key components in the car, an operator of
cars-as-a-service offering could gather insight on a car's mechanical
state close to the quality of that offered by a human inspection, in
real time. This has the potential to reduce the rate of failures in
such a service. If the sensor coverage was sufficient enough, this
could lead to cost savings through reduced servicing and also decrease
turn-around times, important in a service that will have more frequent
car hiring than a traditional arrangement. This is slightly
exacerbated by an EV context, namely because the workings of EV power
trains have less of a mechanical history than their ICE counterparts
simply by way of being a newer technology.

\subsubsection{Live Air Quality Management (Smart/MaaS)}

Bristol City Council currently monitors air quality through a
portfolio of permanent and semi-permanent sensor installations at
points distributed around the city. In a typical UK urban environment,
particularly one with no major heavy industry, air quality is
primarily determined by road transport emissions, particularly those
of diesel vehicles. It can be hypothesised that if it was possible to
understand the distribution of vehicles in the city at any one point
in time, it would be possible to estimate, the air quality across the
entire city, to an acceptable degree of accuracy.

At present, in some areas of the city, car flow is monitored by
car-recognising/ANPR cameras. Coverage however is poor and scaling
this can be prohibitively expensive. Cars-as-a-service vehicles are
likely to have near-identical behaviour to other cars on the road at
that time. With a sufficient coverage of hire cars distributed among
the main car parc, the total car distribution in Bristol could be
extrapolated. Today other data sets exist for understanding car
movements around a city (produced by mapping apps such as Google
Maps), but this is not always available to cities, nor is it
necessarily free. This could be complimented by data from air quality
sensors directly affixed on to cars.

%We will examine critical resolutions in detail in Section~\ref{barriersenablers}.


\subsubsection{Live Accident Reporting (Smart/MaaS)}

Cars could be fitted with impact sensors, altering a cars-as-service
monitoring system that a car has suffered a crash, enabling them to
immediately alert the authorities. A number of trends have
significantly improved road safety in the UK over the last 20 years
and combined with the relative rarity of such a scheme to have rural
isolated crashes means it is unlikely that such a systems a tangible
improvement in fatality rates from users of the service. Instead, it
is more likely that the main benefit of such a system would an
improved perception of safety by the user. It may also be possible
that through connectivity to city transport systems, a system could
alert traffic control teams of potential disruptions.

  Transport Hub, structured by input transport modes (left) and output
  transport services}
\label{fig:bristolhub}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{User Journey Data (Smart/MaaS)}

Social media websites have shown that advertisement hit rates can be
greatly improved by accurate targeting of the advert to the correct
recipient. Depending on the medium of transport being used,
historically this technique would be attempted by advertising at a
particular time or in a particular geographical area. Today however,
consumers are increasingly expressing preferences and specifics around
their personal situation in data through social media networks, and it
is possible to target individuals of a range of highly specific
criteria, such as a specific relationship status, group affiliation or
patrons of specific rival businesses.  Facebook and Spotify are
frequently highlighted examples of how these mechanisms can not only
deliver high conversion rates -- enabling the advertising to be sold at
higher prices -- but also enabler the sale of smaller, but still
effective, advertising packages to smaller businesses. This mechanism
could produce value in a cars-as-as-service offering in two identified
ways.

Information on the journeys of car hire users, contextualised with
time of use and demographic details, could be sold -- wider privacy
and ethical considerations notwithstanding -- as valuable data
companies in local retail and leisure sectors. Such clients can
consider the expensive customer research they would otherwise have to
undertake to obtain such data, and so a base price is conceivable.
Alternatively, such data could be used in house in the form of
targeted advertising in-vehicle. Organisations could partner with the
service, offering promotional deals to users it believes it may be
able to tempt to their business during or after the trip. This could
be done in real time using spatial data e.g. when an individual
approaches a particular business. The value creation could be twofold:
the advertising organisations could pay for the in-car advertising
rights if they are showing simply promotional material; if appealing
deals are provided, more users would be more inclined to use the
service. This second mechanism is likely to enjoy higher data consent
rates from users as the value to them is more direct.


\subsubsection{Demand-based Pricing (Smart/MaaS/EV)}

An alternate method to control congestion is to bring economic forces
to bare on when an individual chooses to travel. In practice, a MaaS
could include an additional influence based on the expected congestion
of the roads at point of travel, attempting to deter travel that would
exacerbate the congestion. Ultimately, this requires the highest
critical resolution of a MaaS service of all the use cases addressed
here. Furthermore, many ethical dilemmas exist. It might be extremely
unpopular that the most sustainable cars are essentially `taxed' into
staying off the roads, while the unsustainable private transport is
free to do as it wishes.

However another interpretation is around the ability to better control
demand for the service, a key consideration for electric vehicles due
to the fact that, even in the increasing affordability of fast
chargers, EVs require considerably longer than ICE cars to transition
from zero to full range capacity. Thirdly, this can also be used to
manage car supply and demand between different nodes of car
collection. There are a number of scenarios where the ability to
maintain a serviceable fleet at a node could be jeopardised:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\emph{Inclement driving conditions:}} Compared to ICEs, EV's
energy consumption per mile is more susceptible to influence from
weather conditions. Colder weather can have negative effects on the
motor and battery performance. Furthermore, car cabin heaters in EVs
do not have engine heat stream to redirect, so additional power from
the battery is required to generate this, measured to be as much as
15\%~\citep{dft:2008}. Live battery data could enable the
cars-as-as-service management system to know the exact power use of a
journey and thus the expected battery use available at the end of a
journey.
\item {\emph{Congestion:}} High levels of traffic, resulting in
'stop-start driving’ can significantly decrease the efficiency of an
EV, although the effect is not as pronounced as with an ICE as an EV
powertrain can turn off and on with less energy loss. Congestion also
decreases journey time. Car speed data and GPS location data could
inform the booking management system when a car is likely to have
reduced efficiency, and when it is unlikely to be back at a node when
expected.
\item {\emph{Satellite navigation:}} Knowing the intended destination
of a user can help pre-empt different levels of EV occupancy at nodes,
and advise where a space needs to be made available. Furthermore, live
satellite navigation data can advise what route is taken, and how this
effects the arrival time and level of charge at arrival.
\end{enumerate}

Pre-warning of any of these unforeseen circumstances can allow
immediate shifting of the booking system to reflect increased hire
duration or increased charging duration. This will prevent people
booking in a time when the car will now be driving/charging. The value
from this system comes from improved reliability of the car hire
service. Insight from these and other scenarios will advise the
cars-as-a-service operation system of when which EVs are likely to be
at which nodes and with what charge, allowing interventions that
adjust pricing at different nodes to ensure space at current
destination nodes and availability of charged cars across all
nodes. An example of a simple dynamic pricing formula can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:smartpricingformula} whereby the `smart power'
determines the degree of extremity in the dynamic pricing.  A
simulation exploring the potential impact of demand-based pricing
based on such an algorithm, on revenue and variance of booking
density, for a designed service of `smart EV MaaS' as part of the
{\emph{Bristol Smart EV Hub}} project, can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:smartpricegraphs}.

At least on theoretical customer behaviour, it is possible to create a
scenario through dynamic pricing where both total revenue is increased
and bookings are more evenly distributed. This mechanism could be made
stronger; or seen to be more of a `carrot' than a `stick' strategy by
the use of reduced parking costs in non- or limited-nodal MaaS
systems.

\subsubsection{Driving Styles and Usage Habits (Smart/EV/MaaS)} 

As a high growth market, the EV market is currently undergoing heavy
R\&D investment. As a distinctly different driving experience,
automotive designers are particularly interested in how users interact
with the vehicle~\citep{ferreira-et-al:2013}. Such data is not
currently commonplace and as such; to create this car manufacturers
spend capital on customer surveys, on-road testing and other
investments.

% do we need a ref here?
A similar situation can be observed in the in the car insurance
industry; at present relatively few car insurers offer cover for EVs
due to a poor understanding of their risk. Those that do offer prices
above the ICE equivalent average 16-26\% more. It is unclear if EV
owners drive in an identical manner to combustion car owners, or if
they are at a higher risk of collision due to lower noise and
potential higher accelerations than combustion cars. Furthermore, many
fundamental components of the EV have yet to come close to their
expected end of life, so it is risky for insurers who do not know if
the vehicles will reach their rated life.

The UK's National Grid could derive value in how EV charging in a
cars-as-service models has an impact on the grid, steering their
strategic investment accordingly.  Although information is available
around how privately-owned EVs require charging
users~\citep{kennel-et-al:2012,darabi+ferdowsi:2013}, EVs in frequent
trips throughout the day could have distinctly different charging
requirements. The value of this insight also extends to regional
distribution network operators, who hold the responsibility of
ensuring local networks can service supply, and the nodal distribution
of this service’s cars could have significant impacts upon that. It is
reasonable to assume there is value in these data sets to the operator
of an EV MaaS system, through external sale, if a data strategy was in
place to collect, store and market this.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Traffic Routing (Smart/MaaS)} 

Understanding the average speed of a road's cars allows the city's
transport management to predict the related areas of congestion. The
necessary resolution of this is much lower i.e. the speed of a given
stretch of road is largely similar for all vehicles driving along
it. Knowing such information in real time, the city transport
management team can employ data-based traffic management
techniques. One of the most common of these is the notion of dynamic
traffic re-routing. Road users are directed to the fastest route to a
given location by being mindful of congestion. The car hire scheme
takes this concept one step further, as it will be possible to
understand where individuals are planning on driving in advance. With
this information, mitigation actions that would previously be
considered to have too long a lead time even in the 'live' mode can be
implemented. For example, higher use of contraflow lanes that can be
dynamically adjusted to allow for the particular nature of the rush
hour traffic, increased public transport frequencies to help move
demand off the roads, or variable speed limits to maximise flow rates
and relieve bottlenecks.

Much of the infrastructure necessary to facilitate this has already
been tested at scale: dynamic lane direction has proven successful on
the M6 (intercity) motorway around Birmingham and the M25 London
orbital motorway in the UK, with extensive supporting evidence about
its dynamic speed limit interventions. This infrastructure could be
improved in effectiveness from data that was faster and more accurate
than existing, predominantly analogue sensing techniques.  A criticism
of this concept might be that such data sets are currently collected
by global technology firms such as Google. Such data however is not
readily available to cities, and when it does, it typically comes with
a substantial cost. A MaaS service would have access to this data and
could provide it to the city's transport team.


\subsubsection{Grid Balancing (EV/Smart/MaaS)} 

Grid balancing is a generalised term for the concept of taking action
to mitigate for surpluses of supply or shortages in demand in a region
or nation’s electricity system. In some definitions, balancing
involves transferring power into the grid, but many techniques of
simply avoiding drawing power (a.k.a. {\emph{shaving}}) or moving the demand
to another period (a.k.a. {\emph{shifting}}) are considered balancing by the
UK Government~\citep{decc:2014}. The challenge of balancing the network
is becoming much larger with more distributed generation and larger
power demands. Many stakeholders in the UK's energy industry are
increasingly providing financial incentives for these services and
view it as an important challenge of the future. Almost all of these
solutions involve some aspect of a `smart grid', i.e. that data is
used in the management of these interventions.

This is difficulty is highly relevant to EVs as they represent a
growing load on the grid; some studies have suggested even moderate
uptake of EVs might increase national power demand by up to 23\% in
some areas by 2021~\citep{paffumi-et-al:2015}. However, of greater
concern based on early observations that EVs will increase the
variation (essentially the peakiness) in grid demand, a quality that
is harder to service than total demand. However, at the same time
their potential to be used as charge storing devices enables a
situation whereby theoretically, rather than being seen as a burden on
the grid which needs to be minimised, they could be seen as a positive
asset to provide charge to meet demand at peak times. Typically
batteries have a very quick response rate to grid requirements,
something other balancing solutions can lack.

Crucially for our study, this would be exacerbated in a MaaS offering,
whereby the value of the charge to the grid at that time is factored
into the cost of someone instead using that charge to drive the
car. The cars could then be used as grid balancing charge storage in
periods of lower demand. Logistically, a MaaS arrangement would have
EVs plugged in by default (requiring no manual intervention as likely
with privately-owned EVs). Furthermore, such systems would also
typically have large numbers of EVs connected to the grid on
connections with substantial voltage capacity, facilitating sudden
charge and discharge actions.

This potential for consideration as an asset to the grid comes with
the caveat that required charging for the car's actual purpose can be
sufficiently shifted to be of negligible impact. This is compounded by
the context that many of the business models around balancing systems
have yet to achieve commercial viability, and may not develop so in
the UK for at least 10 years. This, along with the general penetration
of EVs -- MaaS or otherwise -- are important factors to consider for
this use case, but are not relevant to our scope of examining trend
overlaps.

% \section{Barriers and Enablers}\label{barriersenablers}

% \subsection{Overview}

% Throughout the workshop and interview process it became apparent that
% there were substantial barriers to both the realisation of these use
% cases, and barriers to being more certain about the specific value
% they could bring. On balance, there were also certain common enablers,
% which added clarity to these two aspects.  This section profiles those
% that were communally considered to be the most important across all
% use cases.

% \subsection{Devolution}

% In the UK devolution is a defining trend of local governance. Cities
% are increasingly being given more power and more responsibility to
% fund and deliver many of their own services. Combined with a landscape
% of fiscal austerity, this combines to provide the motivation, and
% capability, to experiment with new solutions that can deliver better
% outcomes on a smaller budget, or that drive growth, sustainably,
% growing the overall city purse. Driving potential new transport
% initiatives, such as the use cases explored herein, could be such an
% action.

% \subsection{Legislation}

% At present legislation around EVs is rapidly evolving. Only recently
% in the UK it became legal to charge for electricity partiers who
% weren’t registered electricity supplier. Up until this point, although
% designed to enforce strict license requirements, restrict `cowboy'
% generators and limit electricity theft, the law greatly prohibited the
% ability to charge for electrical charging for EVs. 

% Furthermore, subsidies are a high risk reliance. Payouts for balancing
% services are complicated and have questionable longevity.  There is
% little immediate governmental impetus for demand-based energy pricing
% to support the Grid Balancing use case. However, many energy companies
% have begun distributing smart meters, which many have suggested is the
% best precursor to new demand-based tariffs.

% \subsection{Perception}

% Despite considerable feature in literature, conference and
% international economics as a whole, the value of smart technologies as
% a concept has yet to be universally realised by the business world as
% a whole. Many surveys have suggested that concepts such as Big Data
% analytics remain the domain of large corporations, and are sometimes
% viewed with risk and pessimism by many smaller, regional
% firms. Although motivation for smart city approaches is high in local
% government, a lack of private-sector buy-in becomes a prohibitive
% barrier.  The legacy of many unexpanded `demonstrator' Smart City
% projects compounds this issue (Arqiva, 2015).

% \subsection{Citizen Culture Shock}

% The freedom to use a car when one desires is heavily ingrained in
% Western society, and it's likely some of the use cases examined
% herein, particularly those that involve changing the price of using a
% car when a large number of individuals want to use one, would receive
% significant citizen backlash and so become politically unpopular. The
% most effective implementation of these is likely to be focused around
% shaping these perceptions, such as ostensibly offering financial
% advantages for `good' behaviour, rather than exclusively penalising
% `negative' use. 

% \subsection{Critical Resolutions}

% The issue of critical resolution presents an issue particularly for
% the more macro concepts.  Modelling undertaken the Smart Electric
% Transport Hub project illustrates this barrier. Using the estimated
% number of cars in a rough 2x2 mile square of urban Bristol at peak
% time, Figure 16 demonstrates a simulation of the accuracy of the
% Dynamic Traffic Routing use case, given a varying distribution of
% connected, EV cars within the car parc. The accuracy is defined as the
% ability to state whether a 10 yard x 10 yard area of the city has an
% above average level of car presence.

% As per Figure~\ref{fig:criticalresolution}, the results are
% particularly interesting; at present private EV rates (around
% 0.001\%), the ability to perceive areas of congestion is abysmal,
% correctly identifying congestion vs no congestion with around 5\%
% accuracy. However, by 0.14\%, the system has surpassed the odds of
% simple guessing, and by 0.7\%, the system has reached an impressive
% 90\% accuracy. 0.7\% corresponds to around 70 cars; the quantity you
% might envisage within such a sized zone in a multisite implementation
% of a single MaaS node in Bristol. It is also worth noting that the
% assumptions here are particularly pessimistic -- if spots of higher
% density (rather than simply above average) wished to be found, the
% accuracy will theoretically improve.

% \begin{figure}[!htb]

% \caption{MATLAB modelling of the accuracy of extrapolating to find
%   congestion from connected EV cars in Bristol, UK}
% \label{fig:criticalresolution}
% \end{figure}

% \subsection{Collective Ownership of Functioning Cars Achieved Through
%   MaaS}

% It was identified that some of the concepts identified are considered
% significantly feasible as a result of the nature of the MaaS asset
% ownership. In theory, a car park of `smart' cars that were privately
% owned and ICE powertrain could be sufficient to facilitate,
% theoretically, some of the concepts, such as Dynamic Car
% Routing. However, MaaS is associated as a core aspect of these use
% cases because the centralised ownership of the cars means that
% connected cars can be immediately purchased, and the data is
% considered the operators to use as desired, pending user consent,
% which in turn would be a requirement for use of the MaaS service in
% any way. The concept based on privately-owned car ownership however,
% would take longer to implement as individual's cars are gradually
% replaced with more intelligent cars (assuming they make mainstream
% markets). This organic growth may encounter issues of interoperability
% between cars and systems. Regardless, citizens would need to be
% persuaded to provide their data, and it would not be a requirement for
% the use of the car for them to do so.


% \subsection{Need for Public-Private Collaboration}

% By far the most substantial barrier identified during workshops and
% interviews was the requirement for public and private sector
% stakeholders to collaborate to implement many of the use cases,
% particularly those perceived to have the greatest value. This barrier
% is perceived to have two key caveats:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item The distribution of value created for difference stakeholders is
%   not aligned with the risk and investment each stakeholder is making
%   – many of the concepts herein would create value for the city they
%   are operated in, such as through congestion reductions, air quality
%   improvement, economic growth, that would not translate, even over a
%   long timeline to financial returns for the private sector operator
%   of a smart EV MaaS service. However, the value to the city could be
%   traced to tangible reductions in spending in various other
%   initiatives. As such, business models need to be explored whereby
%   clarity on these distributed benefits is established, and
%   appropriate financial arrangements made to motivate the private
%   sector to push ahead with the investment.
% \item Different capabilities and cultures between the two stakeholder
%   groups – in the context of collaborating on a transport project, a
%   perception was raised that private sector companies are
%   traditionally focused on profit rather than wider societal benefit,
%   but able to efficiently deliver services, think entrepreneurially,
%   and understand and meet customer requirements. At the same time
%   there was a concession that public sector organisations are
%   traditionally more cautious and slower to embrace digital change,
%   but have a more holistic assessment of transport solution and
%   societal benefits. Several case studies were offered by participants
%   to articulate this, particularly the failure of the Kutsplus Demand
%   Responsive Bus system in Finland (Westlake, 2016). Recognition of
%   these differences and creating strategies that embrace the qualities
%   of both will be essential if implementations are to be successful. 
% \end{itemize}

\section{Use Case Value Comparison}\label{usecasecomp}

%\subsection{Workshops/Interviews}

It is clear there is significant variation in the perception of value
in the identified use cases, and the certainty to which we understand
this value and the path to realise it; these are presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:valuegraph}. From observation of the results, three
categories can be generalised:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\emph{Segment 3}}, those that have by far the greatest benefit
but are also the most uncertain. Typically these have the highest
critical masses and require considerable, cross-sector stakeholder
buy-in. However, their potential value could be described as
extreme. Discussion highlighted how these, typically have the most
diverse forms of value, spanning environmental, social and economic
value, beyond simply financial benefits. While, due to the substantial
barriers, these concepts are highly unlikely to be implemented
immediately, their significant potential cannot be ignored.
\item {\emph{Segment 2}}, with moderate benefit whose uncertainty is
somewhat less and who enjoy good overall value/certainty ratio. These
are typically mechanisms that involve the collection, management and
external vending of data. The value of these will be dependant on how
legal and contractual norms around data trading evolve. Furthermore,
cities, including Bristol, have launched open data initiatives, where
certain public sector data sets freely available for use. There is an
ongoing debate about how data monetisation strategies, such as these,
are compatible with city open data ambitions.
\item {\emph{Segment 1}}, with relatively low value but relatively
high certainty. This group are best characterised as 'operational'
changes, and as such require relatively little collaboration across
stakeholder groups.
\end{itemize}

% As a means of validation, these workshop findings have been compared
% to a systems dynamics model created to explore financial estimations
% of some of the identified concepts, per-node for the Hub
% project. While of a similar context, this model was created outside of
% this research initiative. A Sankey diagram out of this model can be
% seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sankey}.

% It can be observed that, allowing for small differences in the
% categorisation of use cases (some were dissected for easier
% modelling), definition of value and certainty, relative proportions
% match our workshop findings.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

There is clearly synergistic value within the overlaps of the proposed
`Tri-Opt', confirming the original hypothesis. However it appears the
specifics of this are somewhat different to initial speculation. The
findings suggest concepts that combine MaaS offerings and digital
innovation are the main focus of value creation which was favoured
over MaaS, EV and digital tri-overlaps. While we can still conclude
that the notion of the triple overlaps exist as an area to be
considered, the original equal status hypothesised is incorrect, and
that EVs are perhaps considered as a simply `significant' development
that is set within the context of two more transformative
opportunities of MaaS and digital innovation. Reviewing the concepts
that have emerged through our methodology, value appears to span a
wide range, but is overall significant. Certainty is also variable but
generally averages at a lower point, as is to be expected when
considering that these are all significant changes to the norm that
are at best very uncommon in terms of current implementation.

With respect to recommendations that can be inferred from the findings
within this paper:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\emph{Segment 1}} should be considered good operational
practice for smart, MaaS EV services. However they are not
transformative, and generally provide limited value, so should not be
considered high priority focuses.
\item {\emph{Segment 2}} should be considered as positive additional
revenue streams for smart, MaaS EV services. In particular, they may
be beneficial for improving business cases to the degree that such
services can attract investment and be launched, so releasing the
individual benefits of each ``Opt''. While offering good value for
relative certainty, they are not transformative in and of themselves
and should not be considered end goals.
\item {\emph{Segment 3}} can be considered long term strategic focuses
that have transformative value, and have underlying mechanisms that
span beyond transport. Currently highly uncertain, understanding
these, conceptually, should be a long term, pan-city, high priority
  aspiration.
\end{itemize}

It is important to note that this paper does not set out to define the
value cases of the individual ``Opts'' themselves -- such as reduced
sunk-cost-induced car use in a MaaS model -- and is designed to be a
study of interaction of the three opportunities rather than appraisal
of each concept by itself -- of which there is extensive literature
already in existence as explored in Section~\ref{intro}. These
recommendations however should be appreciated within the context of
the individual benefits of MaaS, smart cities and digital innovation
and electric vehicles.

Our results suggest that there are significantly more barriers than
enablers at play in these double and triple overlapping concepts. Of
most significance in the eyes of the participants, and of most
relevance to the highest-value segment of use cases, is the need for
public and private sector collaboration. It seems reasonable to
presume this is a barrier for `as-a-service' and digital innovation
concepts across a range of city services.

\section{Future Work}\label{future}

For application beyond transport, it is recommended that the
underlying generic mechanisms at play that create value are further
explored. The particular emphasis on MaaS and digital innovation
suggests `digitally-enabled innovative business models' may be the
best starting point for considering these. Taking away the transport
context, several mechanisms be observed in our research including:
sharing of data to mutual benefit (e.g. driving habits), supporting
new service delivery models that bring public benefit (e.g. dynamic
car routing) and assistance of delivering public policy
(e.g. demand-based pricing to reduce congestion).

  dilemma of some tri-opt transport solutions.}

\end{figure}

Little or no research could be found that defines a framework of these
mechanisms and there is a significant evidence base that private
sector participation in city digital initiatives is a regular
criticism by the public sector~\citep{martin:2016}, thus it can be
hypothesised there is value in understanding this issue
better. Related to this, digitally-enabled public and private
collaboration needs to be understood better, as it currently stands as
the major barrier. The distribution of value/risk/investment
identified as part of this, and articulated in a simplified causal
loop diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:causalloop}, need to be further
investigated.
